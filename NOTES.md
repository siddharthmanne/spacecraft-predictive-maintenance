Core DS&A Elements to Include:
Time-series windowing using sliding window technique (fundamental for telemetry)

Priority queues/heaps for alert ranking and maintenance scheduling

Hash maps for efficient sensor data lookup and feature caching

Simple graph structures to model component dependencies

Basic dynamic programming for remaining useful life calculations



Understanding the Problem Domain
A spacecraft has many components, each with continous telemetry streams:
- Reaction wheels (for orientation control)
- Battery systems (power management)
- Thermal control systems (temperature regulation)
- Communication systems (data transmission)


Phase 1: Data Generation and Understanding (Day 1-2)
Instead of just finding a dataset, we'll create synthetic spacecraft telemetry:


Smart Synthetic Data Generation Strategy:
- Create data generator class
- The DS&A element here: Use hash maps to efficiently store and lookup sensor configurations, and sliding windows to generate correlated time-series data.

The data should include:
- Temperature sensors: Gradual drift indicates thermal system issues
- Vibration sensors: Spikes suggest mechanical problems
- Power draw: Changes indicate electrical system health
- Communication signal strength: Degradation shows antenna/transmitter issues

Key Learning Questions to Answer:
- How do healthy systems behave over time?
- What patterns indicate gradual degradation vs. sudden failure?
- How do different failure modes manifest in the data?
